Review of Business Plan Proposal
================================

Opening Remarks
---------------
* The business plan was not clear as to what investment, and to what business the plan is aimed at.
  The presentation of the plan was not impressive, and included some grammatical errors.
* The business plan appears to be for an existing German industrial automation company, to implement an existing distributed control and automation standard, IEC 61499, for smart grid automation.
* The plan is for a mature company, nxtControl, with an estimated value of 5.3 million euros in 2009 by Technologiebeteiligungs-Invest AG investing 2 million euros for a 38% stake [1]
* The use of the IEC 61499 standard is becoming more well known, and has been known to improve efficiency of some projects [2]. 
  Its use in smart grid substation automation is less well known, though there is existing research around it [3].
* There was a lack of financial information, with a total cost estimated around 3 million dollars, assumed to be New Zealand Dollars.
  The duration is expected to be 2 years, outlined in a gantt chart between pages 9 and 10.
* The market the plan is aimed at is primarily controlled or supervised by the government, though they have suggested that the government has interest in R&D projects.
  The project is aimed at substations which are used to control electricity movement through the grid.
  Government agencies control the demand for substations as they build infrastructure, which has not been analysed.

* Verdict: A project structure has been outlined in depth, but fails to outline the project benefits. 
  No equity or specific investment has been specified, the project has no clear demand or revenue stream.
  I would not invest in this venture.


Presentation
------------
The report was not well presented, there were grammatical errors and lack of clear explanation.
The serif font used on the title page was not professional, and gave no indication as to what the business was regarding.
The introductory sections did not explain the business, and it was not obvious for which business the business plan was for.
There were very few references to the company of interest, forcing the reader to make assumptions regarding the purpose of the report.
The placement of the work break down structure and the project gantt chart was in the middle of the risk register, causing further ambiguity.

The primary purpose of the business plan appeared to be more of a project management plan.
There is no reference to a business model, revenue streams, or clear explanation of the plan.
A lot of effort appears to have been placed in organising a plan regarding how to implement the technology of interest.
There is significant emphasis on project management with many diagrams explaining project management structures.
The use of stock images from the internet do not have a consistent appearance and add very little value.

The use of PEST, Porters five forces, and SWOT was effective at showing the market environment.
The environmental and internal business competencies were well explained.
The key competencies of nxtControl are shown effectively and the support and resources that are available.
The use of business theory created good structure in the initial sections.

The business plan failed to sell the business, as it did demonstrate that the existing business is successful, but there was no business model.
The business plan needs an explanation of the what the business is, and what the business plan is.
There needs to be financial statements and a clear financial structure given that there is a large capital cost which is not explained.

Market Analysis
---------------
There was a clear market analysis of the main industry, the core competencies of the company, and the standard which is the differentiator.
There is no market analysis of the building of substations, the market for substations, or any smart grid plans.
There was a lack of sources for information, it appeared to be based on industry knowledge.
The sources that were included did not add value as they outlined a general interest the government had in R&D, and some benefits of the IEC 61499 standard.

The IEC 61499 standard may provide benefits over existing systems, however, the benefits translated to implementation have not been explained and required further research.
There is likely a benefit from using an updated standard in the design of traditional electricity systems.
However, the plan fails to outline these benefits with regards to the venture.

The market analysis needs to look at the industry of interest, that is around substation design and the smart grid.
There needs to be clear evidence that a market which is mostly state owned can benefit from the standard.
There needs to be an examination of how the existing substations, infrastructure and the electricity market is doing well and needs improvement.
Then there needs to be an examination of the benefits and disadvantages of their standard that is being used, especially with regards to existing substations.
Finally, for the basics, there needs to be an analysis of existing implementations, analogous to the project specified.
There also needs to be a full outline of what the market is, from an investor's perspective, it is not clear.

Proposal
--------
Certainly the greatest difficulty in evaluating the proposal was attempting to discern what the proposal is.
The business plan outlines key competencies of the mature company nxtControl, discusses multiple IEC standards, but fails to outline investment plans or financial statements.
The business plan appears to have been written in a more academic context, where there is more effort placed in examining automation standards.
It certainly appears that nxtControl, as a primary user of the IEC 61499 standard has performed very well in the industry in terms of robotic automation.
However given their maturity and size of their market share, it would appear that they have not managed to perform large scale projects such as reinventing the automation systems of substations.

It appears the business plan is outlining a standards fight over how modern electrical substations should be built.
Thus they have outlined their standard, the IEC 61499 standard as a differentiator, and thus the primary market.
The standard is definitely a differentiator, and if this was pursued further, more analysis would need to be done as to the benefits of this standard relative to others, new and old.
The plan does compare it relative to the traditional IEC 61131 standard, stating that it is beneficial if transitioning to a smart grid.
However, they have given no evidence that New Zealand is making this transition in the near future, nor outlining how this automation standard creates its differentiation. 

Financials
----------
There were no financial statements included in this business plan.
There was a small section which outlined some of the costs, which primarily covered the cost of human capital, and did not cover how physical capital was broken down.
This was especially surprising given that there was a clear work breakdown structure which covered all the steps that would be undertaken.
The cost of human capital appears to be approximately correct, though it appears to be for one year, though the project is clearly outlined for two years.
Certainly the cost is severely understated for two years of work unless the project is not undertaken full time.

The cost of other capital, as outlined as 1.5 million, is certainly a significant cost, and the fact it has not been broken down in to, at the very least, component costs, is disappointing.
It suggests that the majority of costs are widely unknown, unforeseeable, and thus risky.
The automation system would be assumed to cost significant, especially if it replaces existing systems.
Certainly a full substation is far in excess of 1.5 million.
It is not clear what the costs are for, and thus it is uncertain what the investment is for.

Risks
-----
Because it is not clear what the business plan's goal is, the risks are uncertain.
The business plan does outline project risks, primarily around project management problems, around human capital, resources and final deliverables.
These are certainly important risks, though given the importance of the electricity market, it is surprising that automation system failure, backup plans and electricity overloading issues have not been included.
There are risks around the product that is delivered, failure systems, contingency plans, and human error during operation all contribute to the risks.
There is also risks around system failure, whether due to natural disaster or component failure, which have not been examined.

Concluding Remarks
------------------
Though there is potential for this to be an exciting prospect, there are too many unknowns, especially with regards to value creation.
The business plan has no coherent structure with regards to a central proposal with which it operates around.
The presentation of the business plan could use improvement, especially with regards to clarity of language, the excessive use of jargon without explanation, and through the use of imagery.
The proposal lacks a clear outline of a venture, with regards to the business model, which is non-existent.
There are virtually no financial statements to critique, of the costs outlined, a majority has been outlined as 'other', or unknown costs, which is not reassuring.
The risks of the business can be quite high, though they have not been analysed in depth, focusing primarily on generic project management risks.

This business plan gives an investor no confidence in what they are investing in, if they can establish what they are investing in.
I would not invest in this business.

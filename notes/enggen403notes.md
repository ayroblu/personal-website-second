A Startup Investor's Perspective

### David Russell - Guest Lecture
* Worked big in Silicon Valley companies a few years after graduating
* [**Due Diligence??**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence)
    * Investigation to get best idea

### Summary
* Issues with Startups
    * Idea/Technology versus Business Model
    * No or limited customer validation
    * No team

### The Lean Canvas
![Lean Canvas](/static/4lcanvas.png)

### Startup
* You're trying to find out what your business model is
    * Repeatable
    * Scalable
        * BECA - needs more engineers to get more work - not scalable
* Mature businesses already know what their business model is

### Customer Validation & Development
> More startups fail because customers don't want to buy their 
> technology than fail because their technology does not work

* Is there a market for this?
* Not always the case - cancer research

* Business models are just *guesses* until you get out of the office/lab/building and talk to customers who can give validation

### Market Validation
* Identify the riskiest elements
* Create experiments
    * Don't just talk to them
    * See what their life style is.
* Is there a market?

### The Lean Startup
* Similar to lean manufacturing (build to order) and agile software dev (feature by feature)
* Personal use - Huge risk - not sure about market
* What's the minimum product you can make to validate
* Make up products and see if customers would like it

### Co-founders
* Few startups succeed with a single founder
* Growth = more people = a team
* Convincing a cofounder is like convincing an investor

### Key Takeaways
* Business Model
* Customer validation fo the business model
* A team of co-founders
* A lean startup methodology

> Ask customers about their needs

### Startup Value to Investors
Further along this list, it grows exponentially

1. Idea
2. Business Model
3. Customer Validation
4. Team
5. Early Customers

Lecture 9 - Cost Benefit Analysis
---------------------------------

### Outline
* Normative question: what level of resilience should be provided?
    * Project evaluation 
    * Regulatory design
* Cost benefit analysis (CBA or BCA)
    * Aim is to identify potential welfare gains – or, simply, maximum net benefits
* Cost-effectiveness analysis
    * Achieve a goal at least cost
* Other considerations
    * Incidence of benefits and cost
* CBA provides information into the decisions policy makers must make

* Normative Questions: What should be done?
* Positive Questions: 

### Cost Effective Analysis
* Cheapest path to achieving a target

### Public Sector Economics
* Focus on Policy
    * In terms of efficiency
    * Fairness? Unanswerable in economics

### Mixed Economy
* Private market
    * Result of society - contracts etc with each other
* Public sector
    * Affects trading

### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
* Gross - market price of good
* No market price? (health, education... )
    * Based on expenditure
    * Not value - benefit from these services

* GDP = Consuption + Government Expenditure + Investment + Net Exports
* GDP = C + I + G + NX

* Services are the biggest sector of the economy - 75% of GDP
* Manufacturing represents 13% of GDP, construction 4%
* Agriculture, fishing, forestry and mining, 8%

### Opportunity Cost
* There are two dimensions to government investment that are of direct relevance for cost-benefit analysis
    * First, government investment has to be financed. Taxation has accounted for about 80% of central government investment in the past (deadweight loss)
    * Second, funds available for investment must be allocated among a set of competing alternatives (scarcity & opportunity cost)
* Questions we might ask
    * Is the allocation between alternatives in any sense optimal? 
    * What are the trade-offs involved?
    * What are the social costs and social benefits of reallocating resources away from government programme X to enhancing resilience of Auckland’s infrastructure?


### Private Sector
* Moral Hazard - take more risks - insurance
* Asymmetric Information

### Market Model
Efficiency
* No Externalities
* ...

### Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA)
* Estimation and evaluation of the net benefits associated with alternatives for achieving defined public goals – in your case resilience, but to what degree?
* First we need to stipulate a framework by which to judge the options & economic states.
* Second we need tools to analyse the states.
* CBA is most common form of applied welfare economics. Its limitations therefore reside in welfare economics.
* In undertaking a CBA the analyst faces three difficulties: 
    1. what are the relevant values of benefits and costs
    2. what should be included in benefits and costs
    3. how should the discount rate be determined

#### Overview
* Accounting stance
    * socio-economic analysis and not financial analysis
* Apply the “with/without” principle.
    * C&B say status quo cf. C&B with enhanced resilience 
    * Scenarios
* Reduce all costs and benefits to dollars.
  * Benefits are defined relative to their effect on the objectives. 
  * Costs are defined relative to their opportunity costs.
* Intertemporal nature of the opportunities foregone 
  * Flows of $ associated with scenarios.
* Sooner or later we will be confronted with things that challenge our ability to measure services in money metric. How will we incorporate them into our analysis?

#### Value Judgements
1. Individual preferences are equal
2. Weighted on market effect?
  * That preferences are weighted by market power (income) => if existing prices are used, then the existing distribution of income must also be accepted

#### CBA based on compensation test
* Efficiency line
* Which is best? 
    * Trade off based on government etc

#### Hicks-Kaldor Compensation
* A Potential Pareto Improvement (PPI) 
    * Pareto efficient?
    * Change where the gainers can fully compensate the losers and remain better off
* B-C > 0
* The sum of money, which, if received after the economic change would make the individual no better, or worse, off than before the change
* Hypothetical

#### Measuring Costs & Benefits
* ...
* Costs
  * Principle of opportunity costs
    * Market price – cement, steel, labour, etc
    * What about loss water quality; increase in crime? Increase in hospital admissions?
* Benefits: (WTP/WTA)
  * Market valued - what people are willing to pay (WTP)
    * Electricity, transport fuel, ...
  * Non-market valued – what people WTP

#### Measuring Benefits
* BENEFIT = WILLINGNESS TO PAY = PRICE
* For “small” changes in output the change in WTP is simply: WTP = Q x P
* For “large” changes then we need to recognise and account for a change in consumer surplus.

### Non-market Values
* Relatively recent development.
* Individuals derive benefit that is not traded in market.
* If interested in value maximisation then these values should be considered.
* Indirect valuation methods – infer value from related expenditures.
* Direct valuation methods – personal valuations revealed through survey

### Measuring Costs
* For marginal changes - the amount of the input used relative to the total supply of the input - then existing price is a reasonable indicator of the value of production forgone. This is the opportunity cost.
* For “non-marginal changes” then need to account for changes in producers’ surplus.
* Which best fits your assignment?

#### Comparison of projects prior (ex ante)
$$ NPV(r) = \frac{ B - C }{ l } $$

#### Value over time

#### Discount rate?
* unknown...
* Marginal productivity of investment
  * Real rate of return the economy’s marginal investment yields
* Corporate discount rate – Rate used by corporations
  * Government borrowing rate – Cost of borrowing
* Pigouvian discount rate
  * We are all short-sighted, therefore use low DR
* Current practice r = 8%

#### Risk
* ...
* Technical versus non-technical risk
* Risk associated with project out comes is usually handled using probability theory – frequency distribution?
* Do not factor this in to the discount rate, treat explicitly.
* Attitudes to risk - risk aversion e.g. What is impact of downside relative to upside gains? Is community wiling to pay the “insurance” necessary to avoid the downside adverse outcome?
* Uncertainty in CBA parameters can be evaluated using a sensitivity analysis or MC simulations

#### Investment and trade offs
* Can't plan behaviour
* All costs are opportunity costs - capital is scarce, problem is to allocate scarce $ to get biggest increase in wealth (NPV).
  * Careful screening of linkages with other sectors
  * Major Challenge: estimating behaviour not planning behaviour!!
  * Large projects crowding out number of smaller – Rank alternatives
* Quantify alternatives in monetary units if at all possible – may involve non-market valuation methods.
* Risk analysis - check robustness of NPV to changes in values, possibly undertake portfolio analysis

#### Pre-project evaluation
* Ask basic questions:
  * What is “the problem”? Clear statement 
  * How do we “know” it needs fixing?
* Evidence based advice is essential:
  * Monitoring records e.g. traffic counts, visitor counts, sewerage spills, PT passengers stranded, etc.
* What can be learned from published evidence? 
  * Changes in behaviour from project investment
  * Estimates of benefits (caution)

#### CBA
* Points to note:
  * Distribution of income
  * Compensation principle
  * Measurement of benefits and costs
* Incidence of costs and benefits
  * Backward: Firm absorbs some of costs
  * Forward: pass on cost to consumers
  * Ultimately affects different groups: owners of capital, labour, consumers, ethnic groups

### Cautionary Notes
* Value of CBA depends on the accuracy of cost and benefit estimates.
* Estimates often flawed by
  * Over reliance on data from past projects 
  * Use of subjective impressions/estimates
* Inappropriate valuation methods e.g. impact analysis (e.g. jobs lost, GDP), use of methods to derive estimates of non-market values (e.g. sewerage spills)

### Other Approaches
* Multi objective
* Impact analysis e.g. Income & employment
* Cost effectiveness
  * Aim is to minimise cost, avoid valuing benefits
* Multi criteria analysis
  * Two or more metrics: e.g. Objective (K) & objective (C)
  * One objective may dominate
  * W(K,C) = aK + bC; questions: functional formand weights “a” and “b”
* Distributionally weighted CBA – Auckland v. Rest of NZ

### Public Goods
* Non rival, non excludable
* Pure PGs?:
    * Radio spectrum
    * View of Rangitoto
    * Use of bridge
    * Judge's Bay water 

### Auckland Council
* ...

### Targets and Instruments
* Payment?
* T2 Lanes

### Externalities
* Unintended impacts
* Non-market values
    * Noise reduction of roading project
* Hedonic model? - crime on house price

### Benefits Transfer
* ...

### Approaches
* Point Estimate
    * point is representative
* ...
* Meta

### Concluding Thoughts
* NZ is small open economy, reliant on trade, value- added challenge, exposed to dependence on imported fuel, Government faces a fiscal challenge; Auckland is the commercial engine of NZ, infrastructure to support development essential
* Drivers in the future: scenarios to account for likely patterns of growth, population growth
* Scope out the constraints to wealth/well being enhancement
* Can’t do it all => opportunity cost – what is being given up when a project(s) get the nod?

### Wiki definition

> The outcome of business operations is the harvesting of value from assests owned by a business.
> Assets can be either physical or intangible. 
> An example of value derived from a physical asset, like a building, is rent. 
> An example of value derived from an intangible asset, like an idea, is a royalty. 
> The effort involved in "harvesting" this value is what constitutes business operations cycles.

A Startup Investor's Perspective

### David Russell - Guest Lecture
* Worked big in Silicon Valley companies a few years after graduating
* [**Due Diligence??**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence)
  * Investigation to get best idea

### Summary
* Issues with Startups
  * Idea/Technology versus Business Model
  * No or limited customer validation
  * No team

### The Lean Canvas
![Lean Canvas](/static/4lcanvas.png)

### Startup
* You're trying to find out what your business model is
  * Repeatable
  * Scalable
    * BECA - needs more engineers to get more work - not scalable
* Mature businesses already know what their business model is

### Customer Validation & Development
> More startups fail because customers don't want to buy their 
> technology than fail because their technology does not work

* Is there a market for this?
* Not always the case - cancer research

* Business models are just *guesses* until you get out of the office/lab/building and talk to customers who can give validation

### Market Validation
* Identify the riskiest elements
* Create experiments
  * Don't just talk to them
  * See what their life style is.
* Is there a market?

### The Lean Startup
* Similar to lean manufacturing (build to order) and agile software dev (feature by feature)
* Personal use - Huge risk - not sure about market
* What's the minimum product you can make to validate
* Make up products and see if customers would like it

### Co-founders
* Few startups succeed with a single founder
* Growth = more people = a team
* Convincing a cofounder is like convincing an investor

### Key Takeaways
* Business Model
* Customer validation fo the business model
* A team of co-founders
* A lean startup methodology

> Ask customers about their needs

### Startup Value to Investors
Further along this list, it grows exponentially

1. Idea
2. Business Model
3. Customer Validation
4. Team
5. Early Customers

Rosalind - Petroleum
--------------------

### Field Units
* Length, ft
* Mass, lb
* Time, hr
* Flow rate, STB/d (oil), Mscf/d (gas)
* Pressure, psi
* Density, lb/ft<sup>3</sup>
* Viscosity, cp (pure water = 1 cp) (centerpoise)
* Permeability, mD (“milliDarcy” = 0.98692 x 10<sup>-15</sup> m<sup>^2</sup>)

#### Conversions
* 1 stb = 5.615 ft<sup>3</sup>
* 1 MSCF = 1,000 standard cubic feet of gas
  * "Standard” implies a reference to standard atmospheric pressure and temperature conditions (1 atm and 60 &deg;F)
* 1 psi = 6,894.7 Pa
* 1 atm = 14.7 psi

### Rock Types
* Igneous – formed by cooling of material that has been molten magma.
* Sedimentary – formed by weathering, erosion, transport, deposition and cementation.
  * Characterized by grain size and uniformity of grain size.
  * Coarse sandstone made up of particles 0.5 to 1.0mm in diameter.
  * Fine sandstone 0.125 to 0.25mm.
  * In general larger grain sizes are associated with better permeability.
* Metamorphic – transformation of other rock types under high pressure and temperature.

### Stratigraphic Principles
* Background
  * The study of rock strata
  * Postulates that strata originate sequentially and create readable record of the earth’s history.
* Principle of Superposition
  * Assumes that young strata overlap older strata
  * Thus spatial to temporal relationships
* Principle of Original Horizontality 
  * Assumes that when sedimentary strata came into being that they are horizontal
  * From the analogy of how solutes are precipitated from a reagent in a vessel.
* Principle of Lateral Continuity
  * Assumes that a stratum can not end abruptly within a basin of deposition, but it must feather out, or extend across the width of the basin and terminate against older rocks
  * Similar to Principle of Original Horizontality - fills basin
  * Implies erosion of faulting if no lateral continuity of a strata

### Depositional Environments
* Fluvial
* Deltaic

### Porosity \\( \phi \\)
* Fraction of the bulk volume of the rock occupied by pore space.
* Diagenesis: the physical and chemical changes occurring during the conversion of sediment to sedimentary rock.
* Sorting coefficient: $$ S_0 = \sqrt{\frac{d_{25}}{{d_{55}}}} $$
  * Extremely Well Sorted (high porosity) (1.0) -> Poorly Sorted (2.0) -> Very Poorly Sorted (5.7)

### Generation of Oil
* Oil is generated from accumulations of organic rich sediments, in an anoxic environment
* Typically only 2% of the organic matter in any accumulation becomes oil or gas
* The organic matter is slowly buried by other sediments – this increases its pressure and temperature over time
* Typical numbers:
  * geothermal gradient of 30&deg;C/1000 m
  * Oil maturation begins at 50 oC, peaks at 90 oC and ends at 175&deg;C
  * If material is too deeply buried temperatures are too high for oil generation
* As oil/gas source beds are buried they are compacted which expels oil/gas from these beds.
* The oil/gas therefore migrates to other host beds (reservoirs)
* Source (Shale) -> Reservoir (sandstone) -> Trap (Shale) (Cap on rising fluids)

### Geophysics
* Propagating disturbances through the earth's crust
* Disturbance is partially reflected back at boundaries between geological formations with different acoustic properties
* Scales:
  * Micro scale – the size of a few pores only
  * Macro scale – the size of conventional core plugs
  * Mega scale – the size of grid blocks in full field flow models
  * Giga scale – the total formation or regional scale
* Seismic Waves
  * P Waves
    * Longitudinal waves
    * Also called compressional, primary, or pressure waves
    * Particles displaced in direction parallel to wave propagation direction
    * Velocity depends on elastic properties and density of the medium
  * S Waves
    * Transverse waves
    * Also called shear or secondary waves
    * Particles displaced in direction perpendicular to wave propagation direction
    * Velocity depends on shear modulus and density of the medium
  * Seismometer: geophone on land, hydrophone in marine area
* Material Constants
  * Poisson's ratio \\( v \\)
    * Ratio of the x direction tensile strain to y or z direction compressive strain
  * Lame's constant \\( \lambda \\)
    * $$ \frac{vE}{(1+v)(1-2v)} $$
    * Effects of dilation on tensile stress
  * Shear modulus, \\( \mu \\)
    * Ratio of shear stress to shear strain

#### Wave Propagation
  * Assume that the medium is homogeneous and isotropic
  * $$ v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{ \lambda + 2\mu}{ \rho }} $$
  * $$ v_S = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{ \rho }} $$
  * Impedence \\( Z = \rho_B v_P \\)
  * Bulk Density \\( \rho_B = (1-\phi) \rho_{rock} + \phi \rho_{fluid}  \\)
    * \\( The:_{} \rho_{fluid} = \rho_{oil} S_{oil} + \rho_{water} S_{water} + \rho_{gas} S_{gas} \\)
  * Reflection Coefficient $$ RC = \frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1} $$
  * Seismic inversion is determining the distribution of rock properties that would generate the observed seismic wave measurements

### Well Logging
* Well logs run tools in the wellbore. This is a hostile environment due to it's depth, at high pressure and at high temperature.
* Logging tools measure temperature, wellbore diameter, electrical current, radioactivity, sonic reflections etc.
* Near well region:
  * The region near the well normally contains mud that was inside the wellbore when it was being drilled

#### Direct Measurements
* Driller's Log
  * Record of observations made by the driller while drilling the well.
  * Rate of penetration distinguishes between hard and soft formations.
* Mud Log
  * Mud flows through the well to remove drill cuttings and manage pressure in the well.  
  * Analysis of returned mud may show natural gas content and rock type from drilling cuttings in the mud.
####  Lithography (Rock Type)
* Spontaneous Potential (SP) logs record the DC voltage difference between two electrodes (one at a fixed position, one which moves)
  * Large SP implies the presence of high-salinity fluids 
  * Small SP typically implies an impermeable formation (such as a shale)

#### Gamma Ray Logs
* Detect naturally occuring radiation from materials such as potassium, thorium and uranium
* Shales normally contain more of these materials than any other rock type so a high value on a gamma ray log implies shale.

#### Desnity Log
* High gamma ray scattering implies a large bulk density (i.e. low gas content).
* Density logs can be used to infer porosity as a function of depth $$ \phi = \frac{\rho_{ma} + \rho_{b}}{\rho_{ma} - \rho_{f}} $$
  * ma = dry rock
  * b = bulk
  * f= fluid

#### Acoustic Log
* Used sound waves and measure two travel times for reflections in a similar manner to seismic reflections

#### Neutron Log
* A neutron logging tool emits neutrons from a radioactive source.  Gamma rays are emitted from the formation as these neutrons are captured.
* The log response from a neutron tool is sensitive to the concentration of hydrogen in a fluid-filled pore space.
* Oil and water have a similar concentration of hydrogen, where a low log response implies the presence of gas.

#### Resistivity Log
* Resisitivity logs can be used to distinguish between zones saturated with brine (i.e. water with dissolved ions) and hydrocarbons
* Equations...

#### Contouring...


### Fluid Flow
* Conservation of mass
  * Net mass inflow = Rate of mass accumulation: $$ [ (\rho u)_{x} - (\rho u)_{x+\Delta x} ] = \frac{ (\rho \phi)_{t+\Delta t} -(\rho \phi)_{t}}{ \Delta t} (\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z) $$
  * 1D continuity: $$ \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} = - \frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} $$

#### Diffusivity Equations
* Continuity equation: $$ \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} = - \frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} $$
* Darcy's Law: $$ u_r = - \frac{k}{\mu} \frac{\partial P}{\partial x} $$
* Equation of State: $$ \rho = f(p,T) $$
* Isothermal Compressibility: \\( \renewcommand{\ic}[4]{\frac{1}{#1} \left(\frac{\partial #2}{\partial #3} \right)_{#4} _{} \\)
  * Fluid: $$ c = -\ic{V}{V}{p}{T} = -\ic{B}{B}{p}{T} = \ic{\rho}{\rho}{p}{m,T} $$
  * Rock: $$ c_f = \ic{\phi}{\phi}{p}{T} $$
* Substituting Darcy's law in to the continuity equation assuming a constant k and \\( \mu \\): \\( \renewcommand{\pder}[2]{\frac{\partial #1}{\partial #2} \\)
\\( \renewcommand{\pdder}[2]{\frac{\partial^2 #1}{\partial #2^2} \\)
  * $$ \rho \pdder{P}{x} + c \rho \pder{P}{x}\pder{P}{x} = \frac{\mu}{k} \pder{(\phi \rho)}{t} $$
  * Neglect small nonlinear term as c is small and squared pressure gradient is also small
  * $$ \pdder{P}{x} = \frac{\mu}{k}\frac{1}{\rho} \pder{(\phi \rho)}{t} $$
  * Rearrange to be in terms of pressure and introduce compressibility: $$ \pdder{P}{x} = \frac{\phi \mu c_t}{k} \pder{P}{t} $$

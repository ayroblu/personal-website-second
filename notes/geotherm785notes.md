Study notes

Rosalind - Petroleum
--------------------

### Field Units
* Length, ft
* Mass, lb
* Time, hr
* Flow rate, STB/d (oil), Mscf/d (gas)
* Pressure, psi
* Density, lb/ft<sup>3</sup>
* Viscosity, cp (pure water = 1 cp) (centipoise)
* Permeability, mD (“milliDarcy” = 0.98692 x 10<sup>-15</sup> m<sup>^2</sup>)

#### Conversions
* 1 stb = 5.615 ft<sup>3</sup>
* 1 MSCF = 1,000 standard cubic feet of gas
    * "Standard” implies a reference to standard atmospheric pressure and temperature conditions (1 atm and 60 &deg;F)
* 1 psi = 6,894.7 Pa
* 1 atm = 14.7 psi

### Rock Types
* Igneous – formed by cooling of material that has been molten magma.
* Sedimentary – formed by weathering, erosion, transport, deposition and cementation.
    * Characterized by grain size and uniformity of grain size.
    * Coarse sandstone made up of particles 0.5 to 1.0mm in diameter.
    * Fine sandstone 0.125 to 0.25mm.
    * In general larger grain sizes are associated with better permeability.
* Metamorphic – transformation of other rock types under high pressure and temperature.

### Stratigraphic Principles
* Background
    * The study of rock strata
    * Postulates that strata originate sequentially and create readable record of the earth’s history.
* Principle of Superposition
    * Assumes that young strata overlap older strata
    * Thus spatial to temporal relationships
* Principle of Original Horizontality 
    * Assumes that when sedimentary strata came into being that they are horizontal
    * From the analogy of how solutes are precipitated from a reagent in a vessel.
* Principle of Lateral Continuity
    * Assumes that a stratum can not end abruptly within a basin of deposition, but it must feather out, or extend across the width of the basin and terminate against older rocks
    * Similar to Principle of Original Horizontality - fills basin
    * Implies erosion of faulting if no lateral continuity of a strata

### Depositional Environments
* Fluvial
* Deltaic

### Porosity \\( \phi \\)
* Fraction of the bulk volume of the rock occupied by pore space.
* Diagenesis: the physical and chemical changes occurring during the conversion of sediment to sedimentary rock.
* Sorting coefficient: $$ S_0 = \sqrt{\frac{d_{25}}{{d_{55}}}} $$
    * Extremely Well Sorted (high porosity) (1.0) -> Poorly Sorted (2.0) -> Very Poorly Sorted (5.7)

### Generation of Oil
* Oil is generated from accumulations of organic rich sediments, in an anoxic environment
* Typically only 2% of the organic matter in any accumulation becomes oil or gas
* The organic matter is slowly buried by other sediments – this increases its pressure and temperature over time
* Typical numbers:
    * geothermal gradient of 30&deg;C/1000 m
    * Oil maturation begins at 50 oC, peaks at 90 oC and ends at 175&deg;C
    * If material is too deeply buried temperatures are too high for oil generation
* As oil/gas source beds are buried they are compacted which expels oil/gas from these beds.
* The oil/gas therefore migrates to other host beds (reservoirs)
* Source (Shale) -> Reservoir (sandstone) -> Trap (Shale) (Cap on rising fluids)

### Geophysics
* Propagating disturbances through the earth's crust
* Disturbance is partially reflected back at boundaries between geological formations with different acoustic properties
* Scales:
    * Micro scale – the size of a few pores only
    * Macro scale – the size of conventional core plugs
    * Mega scale – the size of grid blocks in full field flow models
    * Giga scale – the total formation or regional scale
* Seismic Waves
    * P Waves
        * Longitudinal waves
        * Also called compressional, primary, or pressure waves
        * Particles displaced in direction parallel to wave propagation direction
        * Velocity depends on elastic properties and density of the medium
    * S Waves
        * Transverse waves
        * Also called shear or secondary waves
        * Particles displaced in direction perpendicular to wave propagation direction
        * Velocity depends on shear modulus and density of the medium
    * Seismometer: geophone on land, hydrophone in marine area
* Material Constants
    * Poisson's ratio \\( v \\)
        * Ratio of the x direction tensile strain to y or z direction compressive strain
    * Lame's constant \\( \lambda \\)
        * $$ \frac{vE}{(1+v)(1-2v)} $$
        * Effects of dilation on tensile stress
    * Shear modulus, \\( \mu \\)
        * Ratio of shear stress to shear strain

#### Wave Propagation
    * Assume that the medium is homogeneous and isotropic
    * $$ v_P = \sqrt{ \frac{ \lambda + 2\mu}{ \rho }} $$
    * $$ v_S = \sqrt{ \frac{\mu}{ \rho }} $$
    * Impedence \\( Z = \rho_B v_P \\)
    * Bulk Density \\( \rho_B = (1-\phi) \rho_{rock} + \phi \rho_{fluid}    \\)
        * \\( \rho_{fluid} = \rho_{oil} S_{oil} + \rho_{water} S_{water} + \rho_{gas} S_{gas} % _\\)
    * Reflection Coefficient $$ RC = \frac{Z_2 - Z_1}{Z_2 + Z_1} $$
    * Seismic inversion is determining the distribution of rock properties that would generate the observed seismic wave measurements

### Well Logging
* Well logs run tools in the wellbore. This is a hostile environment due to it's depth, at high pressure and at high temperature.
* Logging tools measure temperature, wellbore diameter, electrical current, radioactivity, sonic reflections etc.
* Near well region:
    * The region near the well normally contains mud that was inside the wellbore when it was being drilled

#### Direct Measurements
* Driller's Log
    * Record of observations made by the driller while drilling the well.
    * Rate of penetration distinguishes between hard and soft formations.
* Mud Log
    * Mud flows through the well to remove drill cuttings and manage pressure in the well.    
    * Analysis of returned mud may show natural gas content and rock type from drilling cuttings in the mud.

####    Lithography (Rock Type)
* Spontaneous Potential (SP) logs record the DC voltage difference between two electrodes (one at a fixed position, one which moves)
    * Large SP implies the presence of high-salinity fluids 
    * Small SP typically implies an impermeable formation (such as a shale)

#### Gamma Ray Logs
* Detect naturally occuring radiation from materials such as potassium, thorium and uranium
* Shales normally contain more of these materials than any other rock type so a high value on a gamma ray log implies shale.

#### Density Log
* High gamma ray scattering implies a large bulk density (i.e. low gas content).
* Density logs can be used to infer porosity as a function of depth $$ \phi = \frac{\rho_{ma} + \rho_{b}}{\rho_{ma} - \rho_{f}} $$
    * ma = dry rock
    * b = bulk
    * f= fluid

#### Acoustic Log
* Used sound waves and measure two travel times for reflections in a similar manner to seismic reflections

#### Neutron Log
* A neutron logging tool emits neutrons from a radioactive source.    Gamma rays are emitted from the formation as these neutrons are captured.
* The log response from a neutron tool is sensitive to the concentration of hydrogen in a fluid-filled pore space.
* Oil and water have a similar concentration of hydrogen, where a low log response implies the presence of gas.

#### Resistivity Log
* Resisitivity logs can be used to distinguish between zones saturated with brine (i.e. water with dissolved ions) and hydrocarbons
* Equations...

#### Contouring...


### Fluid Flow
* Conservation of mass
    * Net mass inflow = Rate of mass accumulation: $$ [ (\rho u)_{x} - (\rho u) _{x + \Delta x} ] = \frac{ (\rho \phi) _{t+\Delta t} -(\rho \phi) _{t}}{ \Delta t} (\Delta x \Delta y \Delta z) $$
    * 1D continuity: $$ \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} = - \frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} $$

#### Diffusivity Equations
* Continuity equation: $$ \frac{\partial (\rho u)}{\partial x} = - \frac{\partial (\rho \phi)}{\partial t} $$
* Darcy's Law: $$ u_r = - \frac{k}{\mu} \frac{\partial P}{\partial x} $$
* Equation of State: $$ \rho = f(p,T) $$
* Isothermal Compressibility: \\( \newcommand{\ic}[4]{\frac{1}{#1} \left(\frac{\partial #2}{\partial #3} \right)_{#4}} % _ \\)
    * Fluid: $$ c = -\ic{V}{V}{p}{T} = -\ic{B}{B}{p}{T} = \ic{\rho}{\rho}{p}{m,T} $$
    * Rock: $$ c_f = \ic{\phi}{\phi}{p}{T} $$
* Substituting Darcy's law in to the continuity equation assuming a constant k and \\( \mu \\): \\( \newcommand{\pder}[2]{\frac{\partial #1}{\partial #2}} \\)
\\( \newcommand{\pdder}[2]{\frac{\partial^2 #1}{\partial #2^2}} \\)
        $$ \rho \pdder{P}{x} + c \rho \pder{P}{x}\pder{P}{x} = \frac{\mu}{k} \pder{(\phi \rho)}{t} $$
    * Neglect small nonlinear term as c is small and squared pressure gradient is also small
        $$ \pdder{P}{x} = \frac{\mu}{k}\frac{1}{\rho} \pder{(\phi \rho)}{t} $$
    * Rearrange to be in terms of pressure and introduce compressibility: $$ \pdder{P}{x} = \frac{\phi \mu c_t}{k} \pder{P}{t} $$

### Radius of Investigation
* Solutions to PDE show that pressure disturbance propagates in time $$ r_{inv} = 0.0324 \sqrt{\frac{kt}{\phi \mu c_t}} % _ $$
* \\( k = \\) ?? mD
* \\( \phi = \\) porosity 
* \\( \mu = \\) ?? cp
* \\( c_t = \\) psi<sup>-1</sup>

### Well Test Analysis
* Appraisal of reservoir permeability
* Considers the response of the pressure at a well to a sudden change in flow rate
* Shut-in --build up--> opened --pressure drop-->
* Solutions to this problem are solutions to the diffusivity equation in radial coordinates
    $$ \frac{1}{r} \pder{}{r} \left( r \pder{p}{r} \right) = \frac{\phi\mu c_t}{k} \pder{p}{t} $$

#### Ei-Function Solution
* Pressure 
    $$ p = p_ i + 70.6 \frac{qB\mu}{kh} Ei \left( - \frac{948 \phi \mu c_t r^2}{kt} \right) % _$$
    $$ -Ei(-x) \equiv \int\limits^\infty_x \frac{e^{-u}}{u} \; \mathrm{d}u $$
* Log approximation
    $$ p \cong p_i + 162.6 \frac{q B \mu}{kh} log_{10}\left(\frac{1688\phi \mu c_t r^2}{kt} \right) % _ $$
    * Applies when 
        $$ \frac{948 \phi \mu c_t r^2}{kt} < 0.01 $$

### Characterizing Damage and Stimulation
* Damage Caused by Drilling Fluid
    * Mud filtrate invasion in to the area around the wellbore - reduces porosity
* Damage Caused by Production
    * \\( p < p_b \\) near the wellbore and \\( p > p_b \\) away from the wellbore.
* Damage Caused by Injection
    * Dirty / incompatible water
* Reservoir Model of Skin Effect
    * Altered zone near, bulk formation far
    * ummm?
* Skin and Pressure Drop
    $$ s= \frac{ 0.00708 kh}{q B \mu}{\Delta p_s} $$
    $$ \Delta p_s = \frac{141.2q B \mu}{kh} s $$
* Geometric Skin
    * Converging Flow to Perforations
        * Flow travels up or down in to perforations
    * Partial Penetration
    * Well With Hydraulic Fracture
    * Reservoir Pressure Profile
        * s = -2 -> Higher pressure near wellbore
        * s= 5 -> Lower pressure near wellbore
    * Incorporating Skin into the Ei-Function Solution
        * \\( r = r_w \\)
        $$ p = p_ i + 70.6 \frac{qB\mu}{kh} Ei \left( - \frac{948 \phi \mu c_t r_w^2}{kt} - 2s\right) % _$$
    * Log Approximation to the Ei-Function
        $$ p_{wf} = p_ i - 162.6 \frac{qB\mu}{kh} \left[ log_{10(t) + log_{10}\left(\frac{k}{\phi \mu c_t r_w^2}\right) - 3.23 + 0.869s \right] % _$$
    * Estimating Permeability and Skin
        $$ k = \frac{ 162.6 qB\mu}{mh} $$
        $$ s = 1.151 \left[ \frac{p_i - p_{1hr}}{m} - log_{10} \left( \frac{k}{\phi \mu c_t r_w^2} \right) + 3.23 \right] $$

### Nomenclature

### Problems with Drawdown Tests
* It is difficult to produce a well at a strictly constant rate.
* Even small variations in rate distort the pressure response.
* There is one rate that is easy to maintain – a flow rate of zero.
* A buildup test is conducted by shutting in a producing well and measuring the resulting pressure response.

* Draw down build up test?

### Wellbore Storage
* Fluid Fill Welbore
    $$ \newcommand{\der}[2]{ \frac{\mathrm{d} #1}{\mathrm{d} #2} } $$
    $$ \der{p_w}{t} = \frac{ ( q - q_{sf} ) B}{24 V_{wb}c_{wb} } % _ $$
    * Unloading
        * Rate near the surface is different to the rate in the bottom hole (0 -> full)
    * Afterflow
        * Rate at the bottom peters out, instant at well head, surface.
    * Wellbore storage time --pressure changes linearly with time--> transitioning to a flow regime where pressure changes according to the log of time

* Pressure changes versus log time
    * Deflection after interacting with wall boundaries

### Permeability in Series
* Similar to series resistors in electical circuits:
    $$ \renewcommand{\sumin}{\sum\limits^n_{i=1}} % _ $$
    $$ \frac{1}{\bar{k}} = \frac{1}{L} \sum\limits^n_{i=1} \frac{L_i}{k_i} % _ $$
* \\( \bar{k} = \\) harmonic mean permeability
* L is the length of that unit

### Permeability in Parallel
* Arithmetic mean, all fluid flows across its own layer
    $$ \bar{k} = \sumin \frac{k_i A_i}{A_{tot}} % _ $$
* A is the area

### Radial Flow
* Flow in a radial geometry, with Darcy's law
    $$ Q = (2 \pi r h) \frac{k}{\mu} \der{p}{r} $$
* edge = e, w = well
* Steady State, \\( p_e \\) is constant (aquifier influx)
    $$ Q = \frac{kh ( p_e - p_{wf})}{141.2 \mu B \ln{\left( \frac{r_e}{r_w} + s \right) } } % _ $$
* Pseudo Steady State - Sealed boundary
    $$ Q = \frac{kh ( \bar{p} - p_{wf})}{141.2 q \mu B \left( \ln{\left( \frac{r_e}{r_w} \right) } - \frac{3}{4} + s \right) } % _ $$
    * Average Reservoir Pressure
        * For production based solely on expansion of rock and fluid as a system is depressurised, i.e. without water or gas injection
        $$ \bar{p} = p_i - \frac{BN_p}{\phi h \pi(r_e^2-r_w^2)c_t} $$
        * \\( p_i = \\) initial reservoir pressure, psi
        * \\( B = \\) formation volume factor, RB / STB
        * \\( N_p = \\) cumulative production \\(= \int Q \; \mathrm{d} t\\)
        * \\( \phi = \\) porosity, fraction
        * \\( h = \\) reservoir thickness, ft
        * \\( r_e = \\) radius of reservoir, ft
        * \\( r_w = \\) wellbore radius, ft
        * \\( c_t = \\) total compressibility, psi<sup>-1</sup>
    * Combining average reservoir pressure and flowrate,pressure relationship:
        $$ p_{wf} = p_ i - 141.2 \frac{qB\mu}{kh} \left[ \ln \left( \frac{r_e}{r_w} \right) -\frac{3}{4} + s \right] - 5.615 \frac{qB}{V_Pc_t} t $$
    * Implications
        * In a closed system, if the flowing bottom hole pressure (p<sub>wf</sub>) is fixed, and the well flow rate will decline as the average reservoir pressure declines.
        * These equations give us a way to quantify impact of skin factor (extra near well pressure drop on production).
        * Permeability can be used as an average permeability to capture geological heterogeneity (e.g. series/parallel issue).

### Dimensionless Variables
* Rearrange well testing pressure:
    $$ 
    \begin{align*} 
        p &= p_ i + 70.6 \frac{qB\mu}{kh} Ei \left( - \frac{948 \phi \mu c_t r^2}{kt} \right) \\\\ % _
        \frac{ kh(p_i - p) }{ 141.2 qB \mu } &= - \frac{1}{2} Ei \left( \frac{\left( \frac{r}{r_w} \right)^2}{ 4 \left( \frac{ 0.0002637 kt }{\phi \mu c_t r_w^2} \right)}    \right) \\\\
        p_D &= -\frac{1}{2} Ei \left( - \frac{r_D^2}{4 t_D} \right) \\\\
        p_D &= \frac{ kh(p_i - p) }{ 141.2 qB \mu } \\\\
        r_D &= \frac{r}{r_w} \\\\
        t_D &= \frac{ 0.0002637 kt }{\phi \mu c_t r_w^2} \\\\
        s     &= \frac{ kh\Delta p_s }{ 141.2 qB \mu } \\\\
        C_D &= \frac{ 0.8936 C }{\phi c_t h r_w^2}
    \end {align*}
    $$

    * Aquifier
    * Linear, then kink to steeper line, derivative is linear then drops to 0

### Reserves
* Proved Reserves
    - P90
* Unproved Reserves
    * Probable reserves
        - P50
    * Possible reserves
        - P10
        - 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable plus possible reserves
* Preserves tended to grow post production

### Uncertainty Evolution
1. Explored
2. Appraisal
3. Developed - development decision

### Unconventional Resources
* Resource Triangle
    * Implies that the world has ample hydrocarbon resources
    * Top is less expensive to develop and produce.
    * Conventional Resources -down-> Unconventional
    * High-medium quality -> low perm oil, tight gas sands -> gas shales, heavy oil, coalbed methane -> gas hydrates, oil shale
    * Increasing pricing and technology ->
    * Unconventional gas
        * Gas shale
            * Major growth area
            * Low permeability so flow rates and overall gas production per well is lower than conventional systems
        * Tight Gas
            * Gas production from very low porosity (10% or less) rock which has low permeability (0.1 milliDarcy or less)
            * These sandstone (or sometimes carbonate) formations are produced in a similar manner to gas shale
        * Coalbed Methane
            * Gas occurs naturally in coal seams and can cause explosions in coal mines
            * Gas absorbs to surface of coal and will desorb if pressure is lowered by pumping water out of the system
            * De-watering -> Two-phase Gas-water Production -> Decline Production (decreasing water rate, increasing gas rate, then decline
        * Methane Hydrates
            * May contain many times more gas than the volumes stored in conventional reservoirs
            * Deposits are at 300 to 500m deep (i.e. shallow) and must be depressurised to be produced.
            * This is an endothermic process?
* Commercial Issues
    * Well flow rates are typically low.
    * Heating may be required.
    * Reserves may be in permafrost regions – environmental damage must be avoided.
    * Recovery could be enhanced by injecting CO2 into deposits (carbon credits?)
    * Japan aiming for commerical extraction by the year 2016, China spending $1 million US on hydrates research
* Heavy Oils
    * Heavy oil is very viscous oil that is typically high in sulphur and heavy metals.
    * Common in Canada and Venezuala.
    * Heavy oil is considered to be 3 to 4 times more expensive to produce than conventional oil.
    * Produced by injecting steam into a horizontal wells that heats the oil so it can flow to a nearby horizontal production well.
        * Meaning: heat and mass in one well pushes in to other well
* Tar Sands
    * Also known as oil sands / bitumen sands
    * Extremely viscous oil that will not flow by any enhanced recovery mechanism
    * These deposits are *open put* mined and then upgraded in a high temperature process
* Oil Shale
    * Fine grained sedimentary rocks where oil forms
    * Like tar sands however they need to be heated (to 650&deg;F!) to recover the oil
    * Price sensitive process
    * Freeze walls, remove water, drill heating and recovery wells. 
    * 1 unit of energy in, 3-4 out.
* Peak Oil
    * Maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached
    * Occured in the 1970s for USA - now imports dominate
    * Hubbert Curve
        * Accurately predicted the timing of the peak of US oil production
            $$ \begin{align*} 
                \pder{Q}{t} &= P = K Q \left( 1 - \frac{Q}{PRR} \right) \\\\
                P &= \text{Production rate} \\\\
                Q &= \text{Cumulative production} \\\\
                URR &= \text{Ultimate recoverable resource} \\\\
                K &= ????
                \end{align*}
            $$
        * Hubbert linearisation???
    * Currently 86 mbd
    * Forcasting mostly within the next 50 years, with worst case, all oil gone by next century
* Reserves additions
    * Low chance of lots of cheap oil, probably going to be expensive
    * Production exceeds discovery now
* Hirsch Report 
    * Predicts Peak oil between 2005 and 2015, shell at 2025+
    * Mitigation
        * Fuel efficient transportation
        * Heavy oil/Oil sands
        * Coal liquefaction
        * Enhanced oil recovery
        * Gas-to-liquids
    * Conclusions
        * World oil peaking is going to happen, and will likely be abrupt. 
            - Will peak, abrupt
        * Oil peaking will adversely affect global economies, particularly the U.S. Over the past century the U.S. economy has been shaped by the availability of low-cost oil.
            - Peak = bad
        * Oil peaking presents a unique challenge. 
            - Peak = Challenge
        * The problem is liquid fuels for transportation. 
            - Problem area = transportation
            - Best point!
        * Mitigation efforts will require substantial time
            - Need time
        * Both supply and demand will require attention. 
            - Look at -> Supply + demand
        * It is a matter of risk management. 
            - Risk management
        * Government intervention will be required. 
            - Governments
        * Economic upheaval is not inevitable. 
            - Doesn't have to be economic upheaval
        * More information is needed. 
            - Need more information

### CO2 Sequestration
* Capture CO2 at large point sources and store underground
* Well known as oil industry uses it for EOR
* Weyburn - Biggest
    * 320 km pipeline from Dakota USA to Saskatchewan Canada
    * 30 million tonnes of CO2 stored, 155 million barrels of **incremental** oil
    * USA emissions were 5.8 billion tonnes in 2007
* Maping rock formations suitable for sequestration
* Leakage
    * Confidence of no leakage pathways back to the surface
    * Old wells
    * Faults
* Injection
    * Underground in super critical phase
    * CO2 highly corrosive, careful with casing and cement
    * In depleted oil fields, this alters phase behaviour (consider compositional effects in reservoir models)
* Properties of geo-fluids
    * Rocks in the crust, contains fluids
    * Transport depending on density, viscosity, solubility, miscibility

> **Steam Tables**

### Basics
* Celsius = (Farenheight - 32)/1.8
* Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15
* 10,000 Pa = 1 bar = 14.5... psi
* Bar absolute = gauge + pressure atmosphere 1 bar
* Internal Energy + Potential Energy + Kinetic Energy
    $$ u_1 + g z_1 + \frac{1}{2} v_1^2 = u_2 + g z_2 + \frac{1}{2} v_2^2 + \Delta e $$
* Types of Energy
    * Thermal Energy - Steam and hot water from underground
    * Potential energy - water flows downhill from high to low elevations
    * Kinetic energy – a steam turbine spinning and driving an electricity generator
    * Electrical energy flowing through the supply network to end users
* Thermal Energy
    * Steam tables use the reference specific energy u (kJ/kg) at the triple point for water (0.01&deg;C, 0.006112 bar)
* Specific Energy
    * Specific energy for water u<sub>f</sub> (kJ/kg)
    * Specific energy for steam u<sub>g</sub> (kJ/kg)
    * Specific energy is approximately a linear function of temperature over small temperature ranges
    * \\( u_2 - u_1 \approx c_p(T_2 - T_1) \\)
    * \\( c_p \\) is the specifc heat (kJ / kg K)
        * constant pressure, \\( c_v \\) for constant volume
* Moving fluid adds energy, thus specific energy goes to enthalpy
    * \\( h = u + p / \rho \\)
    * Use internal energy for static, enthalpy for moving fluid
* Specific volumes v<sub>f</sub>, v<sub>g</sub> (m<sup>3</sup>/kg)
    * reciprocal of density
* Subscripts for liquid: f, l, w
* Subscripts for steam: g, v, s

### Example 1 – separation of steam and water
### Example 2 – Energy in a reservoir

### Saturation and dryness
* Amount of steam measured in a boiling mixture of water and steam
* Saturation
    * Liquid saturation S<sub>l</sub> = volume fraction of water 
    * Vapour saturation S<sub>v</sub> = volume fraction of steam 
    * S<sub>l</sub> +S<sub>v</sub> = 1
* Dryness
    * Mechanical engineers use mass fraction or dryness
    * Dryness

            &= \frac{ \rho_s S_v }{ \rho_s S_v+ \rho_w S_l }
    \end{align*}
    $$
* Fractions
    $$
    \begin{align*}
        X     &= \frac{ h_m - h_f }{ h_{fg} } \\\\

### Phase behaviour of two-component mixtures
* The critical pressures of mixtures are considerably higher than the critical pressures of the components of the mixtures. In fact, a larger difference in molecular size of the components causes the mixtures to have very large critical pressures.

> *Reserve Estimation*

### Reserve Estimation methods
1. Volumeric Method
    * Early stage of reservoir development
    * Geology, geophysics, rock and fluid properties 
    * Recovery Factor (RF) assigned arbitrarily
    * No time dependency, no production data
2. Material Balance
    * Later stage of development (after 20% of initial oil/gas is produced, or 10% of initial reservoir pressure has declined)
    * Geological data, rock and fluid properties, production data 
    * RF is calculated
    * Time dependent
3. Decline Curve
    * Later stage of development, when production rate undergoes natural decline
    * Mostly production data
    * RF is calculated
    * Time dependent
4. Reservoir Simulation
    * Can be applied at any stage but more useful and reliable for matured reservoirs
    * Geological data, rock and fluid properties, production data 
    * More useful as reservoir management tool
    * Uncertainties associated with each method
    * More than one method should be used when applicable

### Drive mechanisms
* Recovery
    * Primary Recovery
        * The recovery of hydrocarbons from the reservoir using the natural energy of the reservoir as a drive
    * Secondary Recovery
        * The recovery aided or driven by the injection of water or gas from the surface
    * Tertiary Recovery (Enhanced Oil Recovery)
        * EOR methods to improve recovery (see EOR)
* Primary Recovery Mechanisms
    * Rock and liquid expansion drive 
        * Crude oil, connate water, and rock are the only materials present
        * This driving mechanism is considered the least efficient driving force and usually results in the recovery of only a small percentage of the total oil in place.
        * pressure above boiling point
    * Depletion drive (Solution Gas Drive)
        * No free gas cap, water drive
        * Gas Oil Ratio jumps up after pressure drop, 5 - 30% recovery
        * The low recovery from this type of reservoirs suggests that large quantities of oil remain in the reservoir and, therefore, depletion- drive reservoirs are considered the best candidates for secondary recovery applications
    * Gas cap drive
        * Gas cap, no water drive
        * 25-40% ultimate oil recovery
            * Depends on:
                * Size of the gas cap 
                * Vertical permeability 
                * Oil viscosity
                * Conservation of gas 
                * Oil production rate
                * Dip angle
        * Gas cap builds up and pushes down
    * Water drive
        * Water pushes against reservoir
        * Bottom-water drive
            * Pushing against the bottom of the reservoir cap
        * Edge-water drive
            * Aquifer pushes against one leg of reservoir
        * Very gradual pressure decline
        * High ultimate recovery (35-75%)
    * Gravity drainage drive 
        * Low production rate, high ultimate recovery
        * In reservoirs with high structural dip 
        * Low viscosity oils
        * Good vertical and horizontal permeability
        * Seems similar to gas cap drive...
    * Combination drive
        * Most common drive
        * Depletion drive (with a small gas cap) and a weak water drive.

### Material Balance Method
* Material balance for understanding reservoir (simulation imposes personal will)
* Does not use spatial information - assumes uniform tank
* Requires inflows/outflows/generators, average reservoir pressure profile, material properties
* Oil Material Balance Relations
    * Equation
        * Underground water withdrawal = 
        * Oil Expansion
        * Gas Cap Expansion
        * HCPV Reduction
        * Water Influx
    * Linear form...
        * Equations ...
            1. oil reservoirs P > P<sub>bp</sub> negligible water influx
            2. oil reservoirs P > P<sub>bp</sub> with water drive
            3. oil reservoirs P < P<sub>bp</sub> negligible water influx
            4. oil reservoirs P < P<sub>bp</sub> with water drive
* Gas Material banace
    * Withdrawal = Gas expansion + water expansion & pore compaction + water influx
    * Dry gas case
    * High aquifer permeability causes higher p/z

### Conclusions for Reserve estimation
* A reservoir can have a predominant drive mechanism, or can have a combination of mechanisms.
* Identifying the drive mechanism is important for development strategy and ultimate recovery.
* Volumetric method is applied at early stage of a reservoir, with mostly geological and fluid properties data. As production continues, other methods become applicable.
* Material balance can be applied when about 20% of the initial estimated reserve is produced, or when 10% of initial reservoir pressure has declined.
* MBE is a powerful tool that helps determine the reserves, recovery factor, and drive mechanism. - MBE can be applied to a variety of reservoirs, either with or without water influx.
* Unlike volumetric method, RF can actually be calculated by MBE.
* Volumetric method generally gives the absolute, theoretically maximum possible hydrocarbon in place. MBE gives an indication about the volumes that will actually flow.

### Recovery Methods 
* Recovery
    * Primary
        * Natural Flow
        * Artificial lift
    * Secondary
        * Waterflooding
        * Pressure Maintenance
    * Tertiary - Targets immobile oil
        * Thermal - Steam Hot Water Combustion
        * Gas Injection - CO2 Hydrocarbon Nitrogen/Flue
        * Chemical - Alkali, Surfactant, Polymer
        * Other - Microbial

### EOR
* Gas Injection
    Nitrogen and flue gas: provides gas drive, generates miscibility by vaporizing the lighter part of the oil, enhances gravity drainage.
    LPG, Methane + ethane + propane, CO2 (miscible or immiscible). Recovery by reduction in IFT and generating miscibility. Decrease oil viscosity by swelling.
* Chemical Injection
    Surfactant and alkaline (caustic) reduces IFT. Polymer increases water viscosity and decreases the relative permeability to water phase. Wettability alteration.
* Thermal Methods
    Increase the recovery by reducing the viscosity of oil and thermal expansion of oil. Steam supplies pressure to drive oil to the production well.

### Reasons of Low Oil Production
* Reservoir / rock properties (low k, heterogeneity, fractures, pressure etc.) 
* Properties of oil (high viscosity, low API gravity)
* Pore scale displacement : how much of the oil has been pushed out from any of the rock accessed by injected fluids
* Sweep : how much reservoir rock has been reached out by injected fluid
* Drainage : extent to which the wells can access all the separate segments of the reservoir
* Commercial cut off : the limits of economic production

### Displacement in oil-wet and water-wet media
* Water-wet = water on rocks, oil in pore spaces
* Oil-wet = oil on rocks, water in pore spaces
* What is S<sub>or</sub> (swept zone)?
    * If the capillary forces are greater than the force of driving fluid, trapping occurs
    * Swept = no trapping?
* Relative permeability
    * At irreducible water saturation
        * k<sub>ro</sub> at S<sub>wi</sub>
        * No water permeability - still has water
    * At residual oil saturation
        * k<suB>rw</sub> at S<sub>or</sub>
        * No oil permeability, - still has some oil remaining
* Mobilise remaining oil
    * Reducing InterFacial Tension (IFT): Surfactant, alkaline, HC gases, CO2 injection.
    * Reducing oil viscosity: Thermal methods, HC gases, CO2 injection. 
    * Increasing the viscosity of injected fluid: Polymer injection.
* Finding Oil
    * Swept
        * Unrecovered oil can be in pores swept (residual oil)
    * Unswept
        * Unrecovered oil can be in pores, never swept (not residual oil)
    * Viscous fingering or capillary trapping - non uniform sweep causing 
    * Mobility ratio or channelling or heterogeneity
    * Breakthrough -> injection fluid reaches production well


### Recovery of Residual Oil
* Darcy's law
    $$ p_1 = \Delta p = \frac{q\mu_w L}{k} $$
* Young-Laplace
    $$ p_2 = p_{nw} - p_w = p_c = \frac{2\gamma(\cos \theta)}{r} % _ $$
* For mobilization of oil blob
    * p<sub>1</sub> > p<sub>2</sub>
        $$ \frac{q\mu_w L}{k} > \frac{2\gamma(\cos \theta)}{r} $$
        $$ k \approx r^2 $$
        $$ q > \frac{2\gamma(\cos \theta)r}{\mu_w L} $$

        * Viscous pressure drop = $ \frac{v\mu L}{k} $
        * Pressure difference across a pore of radius r = 2 * IFT / r
    * Mobility ratio
        $$ \begin{align*}
            M &= \frac{\lambda_{displacing}}{\lambda_{displaced}} \\\\
            \lambda_w &= \frac{k k_{rw}}{\mu_w} \\\\
            lambda_o &= \frac{k k_{ro}}{\mu_o} \\\\
            M &= \frac{k_{rw} \mu_o}{k_{ro} \mu_w}
        \end{align*} $$
        * The frontal region in a horizontal flow system is unstable and will break up into fingers if M > 1
* Darcy's law
    $$ q = -\frac{\kappa}{\mu}(\nabla p - \rho g) $$

* Waterflooding
    * Mechanisms That Improve Recovery Efficiency

        * formation damage. 
        * Subsurface fluid control to divert injected water and to shut off undesirable produced fluids.
* Gas injection ‐ miscible displacement
    * If two fluids can be mixed at all ratios and create only one phase, these two fluids are referred to as MISCIBLE.
    * Gasoline‐kerosene, water‐milk etc. No interface exists.
    * FIRST CONTACT MISCIBILITY (FCM): Fluid injected is mixed with reservoir oil directly at first contact.
    * MULTIPLE CONTACT MISCIBILITY (MCM): If there is two phases at first contact (if two phases create a two‐phase with a mass transfer between them). CO2 is not FCM. It requires certain pressure and temperature for miscibility.

    * Advantages
        * Improves M
        * The flow of liquids through more permeable channels is reduced by the polymer solution

### Geothermal Resource Estimation
* Reservoir engineering parameters - porosity
    * Porosity \phi is defined as the ratio of volume of pore space (i.e. the volume that can be occupied by the fluid) to the total volume of the system
    * Porosities are of the order 5-30% in the production zone of a geothermal reservoir
    * However in the tighter surrounding rock porosity may be 1% or lower
* Porosity
* Other reservoir engineering parameters
    * Specific heat of rock, c_r \approx 1000 J/kg K
    * Density of rock, \rho_r \approx 2200-3000 kg/m^3
    * Thermal conductivity K, 2-2.5 W/m K
    * Thermal conductivity of a saturated medium, K = (1-\rho)K_r + \rho K_f
* Heat and mass underground
    * *Mass*. The amount of water and steam underground, per unit volume of the reservoir, is given by
        $$ A_m = \phi (\rho_lS_l + \rho_v S_v)
    * Here \phi is the porosity, \rho_l and \rho_v are the densities of the liquid and vapour (or gas) phases respectively and S_l, S_v are liquid and vapour saturations respectively
* Saturations
    * The saturations S_l, S_v are the volume fractions of liquid and vapour
    * They are commonly used in reservoir engineering to measure the proportions of water and steam
    * Whereas for surface equipment engineering "dryness" is usually used
        $$ S_l + S_v = 1 $$
* Heat and mass underground
    * Similarly the energy content is given by
        $$ A_e = (1-\phi) \rho_r c_r T + \phi(\rho_lu_lS_l + \rho_v u_v S_v) $$
    * Here \rho_r c_r are the rock density and rock specific heat respectively and u_l, u_v are the specific internal energies for liquid and vapour. Note that this can be written in terms of enthalpy:
        $$ A_e = (1-\phi) \rho_r c_r T + \phi(\rho_l h_l S_l + \rho_v h_v S_v - p) $$
* Rock Specific Heat Capacity
    - Properties are a function of Temperature
* Thermal Capacity
    - Differences are small - within error roughly
    - save drilling - above rock analysis
* Prevailing Cut Off temperatures used Worldwide
    - Table of numbers
* Example of an energy calculation
    * A cubic metre of a reservoir is originally at 250&deg;C and a steam saturation of 0.1
    * After a long period of production the pressure has fallen to 180&deg;C and the reservoir is just about to boil
    * Find the amount of energy that has been removed (break it down into fluid and rock contributions)
* Reservoir parameters
    * Porosity = 0.1
    * Density of rock = 2500 kg/m^3

* Summary
    * Most of the energy in the geothermal reservoir is in the rock
    * Most of the energy extracted comes from the rock (90%)
* Area and Volume
    - Inferred Resource -> Probable Resource -> Proven Reserve
* Stored heat calculations
    * A simple method for calculating the production potential of a geothermal reservoir is to carry out a stored heat calculation
    * The basic idea is to divide the reservoir into a number of sub-regions with volumes V_1, V_2, ..., V_N each of which is in an approximately uniform thermodynamic state. The initial stored heat is then given by 
        $$ H_i = \sum^N_{j=1} A_{ej}^{(i)} V_j $$
    * The final state of the reservoir is then assumed to be when the cold water has completely "swept" the heat out of the heat out of the reservoir. Then the final heat content of the reservoir is
        $$ H_f $$
    * The theoretical maximum quantity of useful heat, H_{th}, which is available for exploitation is given by H_{th} = H_f - H_i
    * The actual or design quantity of useful heat, H_{de}, is obtained by multiplying H_{th} by a reovery factor R_f: H_{de} = R_f H_{th}
    * The problem is that the magnitude of hte recovery factor is unknown
    * Values in the range 0.1-0.5 have been suggested by various authors but no really convincing reasons have been given for the choice
    * Some workers have suggested that the calculation of the final energy should not be based on a final state of the reservoir containing cold water, because the reservoir will cease useful production when the final temperature is at some higher value, say 180&deg;C for electricity production
* Distribution of recovery factor used in stored heat calculations of 74 geothermal field assessment

* Conversion Efficiency function of Temperature
* Conversion Efficiency function of Enthalpy
* Conversion Efficiency
* Power plan factor (F)
    * The power plant factor combines (the prodct of):
        * Plant availability factor, which is the percentage of time in the year that the plant is available for generation (excluding shut down for maintenance etc.)
        * Plant capacity factor, which is the ratio of the actual output of the power plant over a period of time and its potential output provided that it had operated at full design capacity during the entire time/year
        * For New Zealand and US geothermal plants F is reportedly high (0.95 to 0.98). Use 0.9 unless justified.
* Heat vs Mass
    * Most geothermal reservoirs will run out of heat before they run out of mass and the stored heat calculation can ignore mass considerations
    * But for vapour-dominated systems recharge is so small that they may run out of mass first

* Summary
    * The reservoir will run out of water and steam after about 10 years
    * At that time the temperature in the reservoir will have dropped from 250&deg;C down to about 232&deg;C
    * Plenty of heat is left and injection of extra water will help maintain production

* Rock Melt Drilling System
    * Costs alot and doesn't work, 2m ish
* Well discharge Stimulation
    * Some geothermal wells can be left open and even though the reservoir is hot they will not discharge by themselves (spontaneously), they have to be started. This is called discharge stimulation
* Geothermal Wells not discharging
    * The cause of the wells not discharging spontaneously is either a low water level or cold formations lying over the hot reservoir. It is possible that hte well would discharge by itself if it was left long enought, buyt it could take several years, much too long for a development to wait.
    - Low water level -> expansion not enough to cover ground.
* The effect of cold ground
    * In principle cold water standing over hot is unstable, and will turn over - convection will begin. But a well is va very long narrow passage for flow, and too much work would have to be done against friction for convection to start along the length of the well. The only means of vertical heat transfer is thermal conduction or the rise of steam or gas bubbles, if they are present. So a two phase reservoir with cold ground lying over it intersected by a well may not discharge spontaneously. However if, the upwards flow of heat may heat up the casing and the cold water in the well. The water will then expand and may reach the top of the well - if it does, then the well will begin to flow with warm water and eventually will produce at the formation enthalpy. This may take a very long time.
* The effect of a low water level
    * The water in the well has to expand and overflow the top of the well for natural dischaege to occur. It may be that the thermal expansion of water is not sufficient to bring the water level to the top, for example in a well where the water level is 600m below surface and the production zone 1200m below surface. The expansion would have to be a factor of two.
* Discharge Stimulation Methods

    * Air compression - Push water down

* Stimulation (improving permeability)
    * The word stimulation is also sometimes used meaning fracturing or acidising wells to improve their permeability
    - hydrofracking - stimulation
    - hydrofluoric acid -> doesn't wash with water, alcohol
    - Arsenic -> doesn't corrode steel

    * Relies on CO2, if there is no CO2, you have no problem
    * Calcite has a retrograde solubility (solubility decreases with an increase in temperature)
    * Solubility increases with an increase in CO2 partial pressure
    * Solubility also increases with an increase in salinity (NaCl)
    * Scaling takes place at the flash point (when brine first boils) due to loss of gas (CO2)

* Geothermal Casing Caliper
* Casing Integrity of Geothermal Wells
    * Damaged production wells would require:
        * Expensive repairs
        * Expensive abandonment
            * 3+ million before doing anything
            * inject cement from bottom to surface, drill through all scaling -> binding better with steel
        * Drilling of replacement wells
        * Substantial decrease in power generation
        * Risk of a blow-out
* Possible Casing Damage
    * Poor cement behind casing (imploding)
        * Cement contains water which expands with heating
    * Casing or liner break (parting)
    * Thermal stress (Buckling)
        * Extension of thrust frame due to thermal expansion
    * Mechanical wear (erosion) - rubbing against walls

        * What about below???
* Solutions to casing implosion damage
    * Tapered chisel dropped repeatedly to straighted out the hump
    * Mill (machine) the hump and run and cement a smaller (patch) production casing (loss in well productivity)
        * Drill + patch = 4-5 million
    * Abandon the well and drill a new well (if there are multiple implosions (after risk and cost analysis))
* External Casing Corrosion (ECC)
    * In the upper 60 m of wells ECC is mainly caused when oxygen can reach the steel casing. Oxidation is enhanced by the high chloride, sulphate and NaCl concentration in the ground waters
    * For 60m and below, ECC is associated with:
        1. CO2-rich water (carbonic acide) solutions (reported in most of the New Zealand geothermal systems)
        2. Acid-sulphate rich waters 
* ECC near the surface
    * Dig a hole and excavated the first join where there was a leak
    * Replace the top-most casing
* Steam Leak (Thief) Zone
    * Geothermal gradient?
    * Less temperature past leak zone - out of well, at level
* ECC prevention
    * Corrosion resistant cement
        * no such thing -> thermal movement results in cracking
    * Multiple lining (casings throug hte acid zone 
        * Foam?
    * Corrosion resistant casing material
        * titanium -> 50x cost
    * Cathodic protection
        * No success -> heat effects
* ECC mitigation
    * Well is sleeved with a smaller liner to an appropriate depth and cemented up to the surface (CHF)
    * If the well cannot be sleeved and the casing damage is close to the surfac, (risk of blow-out). the well should be properly abandoned (cemented)
    * A relief (killer) well might be needed if there is a risk of blow-out (worst case)
* Internal Casing Corrosion (ICC)
    * CO2 - rich water attack the casing at the water level inside the production casing
    * Acid-sulphate waters (< 5 pH in young volcanic (sulphur-rich) areas (e.g. Tiwi; Philippines, Matsukawa; Japan and Tatun, Taiwan)
    * Dissimilar casing material (galvanic corrosion) assisted by fluid flow
        * Check materials are/aren't? self corroding with each other
        * "closed" -> bleed -> small amount out -> keep hot casing -> move up and down to stop corrosion
* ICC prevention
    * Corrosion resistant casing material (e.g. Titanium, Salton sea)
        * Non titanium allows..
    * Casutic soda injection to increase the pH (25&deg;C) above 5 (e.g. Tiwi, Phillipines)
* Corrosion in Geothermal Heat Exchangers
    * Leak internally
* Corrosion in geothermal heat exchangers due to sulphur deposition
    - throw away -> new heat exchanger

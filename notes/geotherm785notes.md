Horizontal Drilling

### NZ Development (Tui)

* 4 Wells drilled horizontally

* Hot, tube, material properties are different

High Risk, High Reward

Petroleum industry does not use SI units everywhere - field units

### Units

* Length, ft
* Mass, lb
* Time, hr
* Flow rate, STB/d (oil), Mscf/d (gas)
* Pressure, psi
* Density, lb / ft^3
* Viscosity, cp
* 1cp = centerpoise = 0.001 Pa s
* Permeability - millDarcy = 0.98692 x 10^-15 m^2

Volume and Pressure Units

* 1 stock tank barrel of oil = 5.615 ft^3 of oil
* 1 Mscf of gas = 1000 standard cubic feet of gas.
  "Standard" implies a reference to standard atmostpheric pressure and temperature conditions (1 atm)
    * Mscf = 1e3 scf

STB = bbl

Moderate - 3000 psi
Gulf of mexico 9000 psi

Temperature = 180 &deg; F = 82 &deg; C

### Tectonic Theory
* Geothermal in Rotorua
* Southern alps
* MYA -- Millions of Years Ago
* MYBP = Millions of Years before Present

Oil and gas through the whole spectrum

### Rock Types
* Igneous --  formed by cooling of material that has been molten magma - **Typical among geothermal processes**
* Sedimentary -- formed by weathering, erosion, transport, deposition and cementation
* Metamorphic -- -- **Don't really deal with them**

### Sedimentary Rocks
* Similar to beach sand
* Sand all glued together
* 20% porous
* Holes microns to 10s of microns scale
* Grain size
* Video: 
    * Coal: Dead vegetation
    * Limestone: Dead seashells

#### Erosion and Deposition

#### Stratigraphic Principles
Date back to work by Niels Stensen (1638 to 1686)
* First Principle -- Young strata overlays Old strata
* Second Principle -- Layers are deposited such they are horizontal
* Third Principle -- Stratum can not end abrupty within a basin of deposition, must feather out (**fill space**)

Fluvial -- River Channels

Depositional Environment - Deltaic
* River Deltas


### Porosity
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)

#### Sorting
Distribution of grain size

#### Porosity: Diagenesis
The evolution of the rock fabric may also change its porosity over time

#### Grain Size Distribution
...

#### Exercise
Thickness: 100ft
Porosity: 22%
Water saturation in pore space = 18%
100 million barrels of oil

714 acres


#### Generation of Oil
Organic Rich
* Biomaterial
* Anoxic - instead of decomposing
* No oxygen
* Mainly plant matter

##### Video
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZQqo7bmy9A)
* Deep pressure
* Heat

#### Migration
Rise through bouyancy, sqeezed like a sponge

### Basics
* Plate tectonics...
* Water trickling down, convecting

### Geothermal Reservoir
* Dominating by CO2, H2S
* Outflow lower temperature, exhaust, not very useful

* Carbon rich water - no resource - wasting money

### Drilling
* Small industry
* Need guaranteed hit
* Not very clean - boron
  * Fantastic image

### Applications
* Used to all come from the power station in wairaki

### Externalities
* Boric acid from extraction
* Cooking - Rotorua
* Healing???
* white - silica ? high salt concentration - gel gooy - corrosive salt - feels good...
* Heating - Rotorua - 100m - 140&deg;C
* Well heats all of hospital
* Heating green houses
* Fish farms
* Prawn Farm
* Drying timber with geothermal - quicker, more heat

### Power Generation
* Note graph is only really about half as big difference as it is
* NZ - roughly 900 now

#### Geothermal Power System
* Not a cycle
* Dry Steam - preferred
* All the money is underground 1% is above ground

#### Single Flash
* High Pressure separate
* Throttle
* ...

#### Double Flash
* High Pressure separate
* Throttle
* ...

#### Binary Plant
* Use hydrocarbons Pentanes

#### Kalina
* Water and amonia
  * Not flammable
  * Slightly more efficient
  * Droplets go with the water and damage the turbine

#### Hybrid Steam-Binary
* Brine runs a unit too
* Geothermal dies with time - more steam less water

### Efficiency
* Only 12% alot less efficient
* Work out out of heat in

### Total flow Machines
* ...?
* Not common

### Types
* Many small 50 MW units
* Type matters for type of equipment need etc.

### Mass produced
* Vapour - low mass
* High enthalpy - steam and water - needs more mass

### Other types
* Hot dry rock or engineered geothermal system (EGS) (HDR)
* Originally didn't work, try again
* Area of New Zealand - Granite
* Granite has no water - doesn't let water through
* Drill through, no water, bring your own water
* No commercial success
* Hydraulic fracture
* Two holes
* Radon from the ground

* injection temp v abandonment temp

#### Sedimentary Basins
* Hot - not pressurised - 1000m deep
* Very saline - 5-6x sea water - hyper brine - 200000ppm salinity - 20% salt
* Subsidies for green energy - commonly used for carbon credits

#### Deep Volcanic (Deep Geothermal)
* 373.96 - Water and steam difference disappears - super critical point
* Hit magma - hydrocloric acid - gooy - broke everything

#### Geopressured systems
* Very high pressure - breaks everything...
* not industrial

#### HFR
* Not commercial
* 1000 - max valves

#### Geothermal
* Red volcanic
* Mining

Lecture 6
---------
* Sadiq
* Steam Tables
  * Not superheated
  * Stay within saturation

### Geothermal Resource Estimation
Not clean cut - looking at main schools

### Porosity
* Need connected holes
* If surrounding rock is low porosity drilling causes gushing effect

> Use eye glass like jewellers

* Thermal conductivity is actually the combination of the given thermal conductivity (K) is a combination of both water and rock

### Energy
Enthalpy
$$ h = u + Pv \; or \; = u + \frac{ P }{ \rho } $$
$$ 10^{-6} m s^{-1} $$
